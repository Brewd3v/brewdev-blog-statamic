        text: 'Lautering is a process in brewing in which the mash is separated into the clear liquid wort and the residual grain. This is typically done by allowing the mash to settle in a lauter tun, a large vessel with a false bottom that has holes or slots for the wort to drain through. The wort is collected in a separate vessel, while the spent grains are removed and discarded. Lautering is an important step in the brewing process, as it allows the brewer to separate the sweet wort from the grains, which will then be fermented to produce beer.'
