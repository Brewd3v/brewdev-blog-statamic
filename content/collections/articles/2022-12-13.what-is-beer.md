Beer is an alcoholic beverage that is made by the fermentation of grains, such as barley, wheat, and rye. The fermentation process is carried out by yeast, which convert the sugars in the grains into alcohol. Beer is typically flavored with hops, which provide bitterness and a distinct aroma to the drink. It is one of the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic beverages, and is often enjoyed as a refreshing drink on a hot day or with a meal.
