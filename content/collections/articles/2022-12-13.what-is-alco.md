Alcohol is a chemical compound that is found in many beverages, such as [beer](/what-is-beer), [wine](/what-is-wine), and [spirits](/what-is-spirits). It is a psychoactive drug, which means that it can produce changes in mood, behavior, and consciousness when consumed. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeast, and is also commonly produced by distillation. The most common type of alcohol is ethanol, which is the type found in alcoholic beverages. Consuming too much alcohol can have negative effects on health and can lead to addiction.
