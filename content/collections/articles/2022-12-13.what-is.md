Hops are the female flowers of the hop plant, which is a member of the cannabis family. Hops are used to flavor and preserve beer, and provide bitterness and a distinct aroma to the drink. The hop plant is a climbing vine, and the hop flowers are usually dried and used in the brewing process. Hops are native to Europe and Asia, and have been used in beer making for centuries. They are one of the four main ingredients of beer, along with water, yeast, and grain. Hops have a number of health benefits, including being a natural source of antioxidants and having anti-inflammatory properties.
