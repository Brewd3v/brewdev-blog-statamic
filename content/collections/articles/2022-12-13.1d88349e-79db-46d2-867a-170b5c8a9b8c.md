        text: 'Hops are flowers of the hop plant, Humulus lupulus. Hops have been used for centuries in beer as a flavoring, preservative, and bittering agent. In modern times, beer is often made using just a few hop varieties, or sometimes even a single variety. Malt is another ingredient added to beer during the brewing process.'

        text: 'Hop bitterness is released from alpha acids, which are soluble in water and are then converted into a mildly acidic compound known as iso-alpha acids. The bitterness of a beer is measured in International Bitterness Units (IBUs), which indicates the concentration of iso-alpha acids in the beer. Higher IBU levels correspond to a more bitter taste.'
