Malt is a type of grain, typically barley, that has been germinated and dried. Malt is used in the production of beer, as well as other products such as whiskey, malt vinegar, and some types of bread. The germination process stimulates the production of enzymes that convert the grain's starches into sugars. These sugars are then used by the yeast during fermentation to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide. The type and quality of the malt used can have a significant impact on the flavor and character of the resulting beer. Malt is also sometimes used as a sweetener in some foods and beverages.
