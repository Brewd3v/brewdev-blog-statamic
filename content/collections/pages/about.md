I'm a software developer who loves to brew beer. 

To keen the observer - Yes, I'm making use of GPT-3 to help me generate content. The plan is to have GPT-3 make things more logical and to the point. I've spent to many hours looking for the real answers. This blog is also a kind of personal reference to things I might forget how to do.

I'm hoping you might find this stuff useful too.
